The error can be avoided by checking for null before accessing the property:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = null;
if (myObject != null) {
  trace(myObject.someProperty);
} else {
  trace("myObject is null.  Cannot access property.");
}

//Alternatively, using the nullish coalescing operator (AS3 does not support this directly, but the following demonstrates an equivalent check)

var somePropertyValue:String = myObject ? myObject.someProperty : "Default Value";
trace(somePropertyValue);
```

This revised code gracefully handles the case where `myObject` is null, preventing the runtime error.
